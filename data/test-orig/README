This directory should contain "correct" files for the full cartoraph pipeline.

At the start of every unit test, this directory will replace whatever is in the parallel "test directory."

Individual unit tests may require some of these files, and then overwrite select files.
The individual unit tests should also verify that the files that are created are "correct."
