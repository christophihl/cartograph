    <h1>Algorithms - Learn How to Make Your Own Maps</h1>
    <p> We start with raw, vectorized data representing Wikipedia articles, which comes from <a href= "https://shilad.github.io/wikibrain/"> Wikibrain</a>. Each article is represented by a 100-dimensional vector that captures its relationship to other articles (via word occurrence and linking context). These vectors are then clustered using the k-means algorithm (<a href = "http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html"> this </a> is the implementation we used.) These clusters will later become the colored countries that are seen on the map. </p>
    <p> The next step is to move from 100-dimensional vector space to a 2-dimensional embedding that we can represent visually. We do this using <a href = "https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne"> tsne </a>, which stands for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. This looks something like this: <img src = "images/tsne_small.jpg"/> </p>
    <p> From there, we draw the country borders. This involves setting a "water level", which floods water into the less-dense regions of the map, creating lakes and coastlines. We wrote our own code to generate the borders, and it can be checked out on our <a href = "https://github.com/Bboatman/proceduralMapGeneration"> Github</a> page. 
    <p> Next, we generate the contours. There are two options: density-based, which is a straightforward contouring where the brighter areas represent higher denstiy, and centroid-based, which draws the contours based on the center of a cluster in 100-dimensional space (closer to the center = brighter color) </p>
    <p> The final generation step involves labeling the map. Labels are generally handled by <a href = "http://mapnik.org/"> mapnik </a>, our mapping library, but we wrote the code to determine which labels show up as you zoom in, and also to determine their sizing </p>
    <p> User interaction is handled by <a href = "http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>, a JavaScript mapping library with a wide selection of plugins to enable functions like search and interactivity.</p>
